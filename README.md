# bear-step
A puzzle game based on stepping on a board. Initially just a game jam submission ([Diyuse/GameJam2020](https://github.com/Diyuse/GameJam2020)), this game revolves around the concept of consequence for each move.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you the source code necessary to build and develop the game. ATTENTION: I frequently delete this repository due to development problems.

## Prerequisities
These software need to be installed:
* Unity, preferably 2019.3.14f1
  * Special packages to have: Input System (version 1.0.0 at least) and Test Runner (verified version at least)
* IDE that supports C# and Unity, e.g. Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code (recommended)
  * The necessary extensions and add-ons for that IDE: C# and Unity addons (recommended)

## Building
Use the in-built Unity builder for the game. There is no special instructions for now.

## Running
Either run the game in the Unity editor, or run the executable built in previous step.

## Testing
There are test suites in this project, mostly unit tests. Use the Unity Test Runner to run them.
