# bear-step
A puzzle game based on stepping on a board. Initially just a game jam submission ([Diyuse/GameJam2020](https://github.com/Diyuse/GameJam2020)), this game revolves around the concept of consequence for each move.

* IDE that supports C# and Unity, e.g. Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code (recommended)
  * The necessary extensions and add-ons for that IDE: C# and Unity addons (recommended)

## Opening the project
